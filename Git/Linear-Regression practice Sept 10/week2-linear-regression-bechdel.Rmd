```

## Setup

Assign roles in your group:

- Manager. Keep group on task. Act as main spokesperson if Prof drops in with questions.
- Time keeper. Try to budget time to complete tasks. (If needed, one person can be Manager and Time Keeper.)
- Inclusion monitor. Make sure everyone is included in the process. Speak up and ask for input from those who keep quiet.
- R Typist. Main editor of your group Rmd file (may want to share their screen so all can see; or can create a shared project)
- Graphics Reference. Have graphics tutorials open for code reference and ideas. (If needed, one person can be graphics and format.)
- Format Police. Make sure the Rmd file has titled sections and watch for typos in text

If you run out of people before you run out of jobs, some people can take multiple roles.

## Data

The dataset is available in the `fivethirtyeight` R package, and is called `bechdel`.

It is discussed in a FiveThirtyEight.com [article about women in Hollywood](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/).

It is a play on the Bechdel Test, a measure of womens' role in a film from a 1985 comic by Alison Bechdel:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://dykestowatchoutfor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Rule-cleaned-up.jpg')
```

(of course, [this is *not* a perfect test](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/22/16807424/alternatives-bechdel-test-bad-moms-lena-waithe).)

To load the dataset and read details about it, run:

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
?bechdel
```

Before analysis, we will limit the data to the years 1990 - 2013, since the dataset creators say "the data has significantly more depth since then". 

```{r}
bechdel_13 <- bechdel %>%
  filter(year >= 1990 & year <= 2013) 
```

(So from now on, we will use the "since 2013" dataset, `bechdel_13`.)

We can also add a few additional variables to the data set.

- `roi` Total **r**eturn **o**n **i**nvestment (gross earnings divided by total budget)
- `profit` International gross minus budget

```{r}
bechdel_13 <- bechdel_13 %>%
    mutate(roi = intgross_2013 / budget_2013,
         profit = intgross_2013 - budget_2013)
```

Finally, adjust the format of the `clean_test` variable to make it easier to use. Keep the ordering of the categories, but do not assume they are equally spaced. (This is a bit of a technicality that you won't normally need to worry about.)

```{r}
bechdel_13 <- bechdel_13 %>%
  mutate(clean_test = factor(as.character(clean_test)),
         clean_test = forcats::fct_relevel(clean_test,
                                           'ok',
                                           'dubious',
                                           'men',
                                           'notalk',
                                           'nowomen'))
```

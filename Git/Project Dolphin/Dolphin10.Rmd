Looking at the distribution of dive depths and duration

```{r}
gf_point(depth_Dive ~ duration_Dive,
 data = wide_dolph_dives) %>%
 gf_lm()
```

```{r}
dives.lm <- lm(depth_Dive ~ duration_Dive,

summary(dives.lm)
```

```{r}
gf_point(depth_Dive ~ duration_Dive,
 data = wide_dolph_dives,
 color= ~dtype) %>%
 gf_lm() 
```

Looking at Surface Duration and duration of the dive

```{r}
gf_point(DurationMax_Surface ~ depth_Dive, data = wide_dolph_dives, color = ~dtype) %>%
  gf_lm() %>%
  gf_labs( x = 'Dive Depth',
           y = 'Surface Duration') %>%
  gf_theme(scale_color_continuous('Dive Type'))
```

```{r}
gf_boxplot(DurationMax_Surface ~ depth_Dive | dtype, data = wide_dolph_dives) %>%
  gf_labs( x = 'Dive Depth',
           y = 'Surface Duration')
```
